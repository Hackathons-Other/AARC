The stock market rises and falls, and with it, so does discussion and speculation on where the market will head. 

Millennial and genZ investors, especially new and active traders, are lost in this tide of information, faced with conflicting recommendations and general inexperience in analyzing investments on their own.

At Demythify, we believe in leveling the playing field for the everyday investor by helping them find more reliable people to trust. 

Being active retail investors who face this challenge ourselves, we aim to use our passion for entrepreneurship to solve this problem.

On our platform, anybody can contribute by making predictions, which we will supplement with an additional consolidated history of publicly available predictions. 

We leverage natural language processing and machine learning models to analyze and quantify the reliability of individuals making predictions.

As an example, if you see a headline forecasting that XYZ stock will grow by 3%, our platform will give you statistics on the reliability of the author of that prediction and help you decide if you want to trust them. 

We'll demo more of the details later on.
